[{"content":"Breathing Through the Sky: My Imogene Pass Run This weekend I had the privilege of lining up at the 52nd annual Imogene Pass Run, one of the most beautiful, brutal, and humbling races I’ve ever attempted.\nThe Start: Breathless From the First Steps From the very first few miles, the altitude grabbed hold of me. I was breathing hard right away, trying to find rhythm while surrounded by so many strong runners. The biggest contingent came from Flagstaff, a town that clearly knows how to send mountain-ready athletes.\nThe route itself is deceptive. People say there’s “only one big hill.” But that hill stretches for 10 relentless miles, climbing 5,500 feet straight up to the summit at 13,000 feet.\nThe Cutoff: A Race Within the Race One of the toughest mental battles came at the 7.65-mile aid station, where there’s a hard cutoff at 2 hours 30 minutes. This year, 296 runners—about 24% of participants—didn’t make it. That knowledge was heavy as I approached the station, pushing through fatigue to make sure I’d be allowed to continue.\nIt reminded me so much of the Kendall Mountain Run and Crown King Scramble—steep climbs, thin air, and that gnawing question in the back of your mind: Can I really make it?\nThe Summit and the Storms At the top, the air felt razor-thin. Every step demanded focus. But the payoff—mountain views stretching forever—made every labored breath worthwhile.\nWe were incredibly lucky with the weather. Blue skies carried us over the pass, but by late afternoon, the mountains did what mountains do: a thunderstorm rolled in. Just like at Kendall, I was grateful to have finished before the skies opened.\nThe Finish: Walking Like a Baby Giraffe When it was all over, I was part of the 934 finishers out of 1,230 starters. My quads, however, might argue otherwise. They were so tight I could barely walk without looking like a wobbly baby giraffe.\nBut even in soreness, I felt nothing but gratitude—for the mountain, for the chance to run it, and for the incredible volunteers who filled the course with energy and support. Aid stations were frequent and full of smiles, a lifeline when I needed it most.\nLooking Ahead Would I do Imogene again? Absolutely—but next time, I’d want to be more acclimated to the altitude. The mountain doesn’t give an inch, but I’d like to meet it with a little more air in my lungs.\nFor now, I’ll hold onto the memory of a beautiful run that tested and taught me in equal measure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-09-07-imogene-run/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"breathing-through-the-sky-my-imogene-pass-run\"\u003eBreathing Through the Sky: My Imogene Pass Run\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Start line\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/2025-09-07/start.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weekend I had the privilege of lining up at the 52nd annual Imogene Pass Run, one of the most beautiful, brutal, and humbling races I’ve ever attempted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-start-breathless-from-the-first-steps\"\u003eThe Start: Breathless From the First Steps\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the very first few miles, the altitude grabbed hold of me.

On one hand, you want to take care of your health and get the surgery done, but on the other hand, the thought of being sidelined from running can be a tough pill to swallow. In fact I postponed for a year or two myself but so glad I got it done.\nRecovery time after laparoscopic hysterectomy varies from person to person, depending on factors like age, overall health, and the extent of surgery. I read may other\u0026rsquo;s and compared with my healing process and was encourging. So I wanted to share mine.\nI went underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy - a minimally invasive surgical procedure that removes the uterus through small incisions in the abdomen - on January 2021. I was in late 40s.\nBy day four after surgery and three days after hospital discharge, I was able to walk about 2k steps with some discomfort. Walking around the house for more than five minutes would give me some discomfort.\nDay 14 post-surgery: I was able to start biking and walking. I experienced lower back pain and discomfort resembling constipation or diarrhea, which I was told can be normal for some during the recovery process.\nWeek 4 post-surgery: I was able to run / walk (mostly walking). Slowly increased distance and pace.\nWeek 6 post-surgery: I was able to run at a recovery run pace though I experienced some discomfort and tightness in my abdomen.\nWeek 8 post-surgery: I felt more comfortable and was able to increase pace and distance.\nWeek 12 post-surgery, I was back to running 20-25 miles per week, just like before the surgery.\nDuring the recovery period, I embraced activities like biking and yoga, which helped me stay active and motivated. I am sure my fellow runners will also find new activities to embrace as they navigate their own recovery journey.\nHappy running and healing!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-04-01-hysterectomy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou might be reading this because you are told that Hysterectomy is the best option for removing uterine fibroids which has been bothering you a lot \u0026hellip; but your biggest concern is how soon you can get back to your beloved activity - running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a dilemma, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?

For those reasons, I have been thinking of other cardio option other than running and swimming. Biking seems so fun with right software and easy on your knee.\nSoftware Just like computer, without right software device (bike) won\u0026rsquo;t be much useful. You will be more motivated if software is good (addictive and stress free) and you will hopefully use your device to the full potential.\nSo I decided to look from angle of software perspective.\nThere are 3 notable software out there.\nzwfit is still in beta (as of 2018-10-03) but getting much attention from indoor cyclist. ifit Coach peloton Setup Options and other cost Zwift Your browser does not support the video element.\nThere are 3 level of setup. This video is very comprehensive.\nAssuming that you already have mountain bike. If not, add that to cost. $100 to $600+.\nBasic: * Bike home trainer * The cheapest one you can get starts from around $50. * Garmin speed sensor is less than $40 Flexible Setup * Bike home trainer * Power Meter. Power meter is is a device fitted to a bike that measures the power output of the rider. Most commonly, power meters use strain gauges that deflect slightly when a force is applied. By measuring this torque and combining it with angular velocity, power (measured in watts) can be calculated. It measure much more than speed and cost more than speed sensor. Premium Setup * Smart trainer which will give you automatic resistance. Smart trainer is available from around $230.\nAlso you want to have monitor. If you want dedicated monitor or tablet, include that in the cost as well.\nMonthly Membership Fee $14.99 (used to be $10)\nifit Coach iFit will give you access to:\nPersonal trainer Unlimited virtual travel Virtual gym membership Workout classes The official training bike is ProForm Tour De France which automatically simulates every hill and dip etc.\nThe software is also available on both Android and iOS and just like most software, review on Android is so low. Chances are depends on your device, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nMax Weight is 350lb.\nPer this review though\nThe automated incline/decline doesn’t always work iFit isn’t well-integrated with TDF bikes (Often crashes) So kind of \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;.\nOther compatible bike NordicTrack Commercial S10i Studio workout video automates your bike’s resistance and incline/decline to follow the coach’s plan. Comes with 10\u0026quot; Smart HD Touchscreen. $1500 includes first year membership cost. $500 more for 22 inch screen bike\niFit Coach membership with equipment:\nPay all at once and save 15% - $33 per month or opt to pay monthly for $39 per month\nPeloton Monthly subscription for the software is $39 if you own their bike. Standalone is $12.99 for a monthly membership but lacks various metrics as it is not linking to device. Currently Android OS user has no option. Peloton is only available on iOS and planning to release for Android on late 2018. So you could go with just buying good spin bike which ranges from\nBike comes with amazing 22 inch touchscreen. With its live-streaming and on-demand classes, costs roughly $3,000 for the first year (Bike $2000 + $250 for shipping and setup) and nearly $500 each year thereafter.\nWithout paying the $39 monthly subscription, you’re left with just three classes and a free-ride mode that displays only real-time data on the screen, with no leaderboard-inspired competition or any record of your efforts.\nNo automatic resistance control by the way.\nNice looking bike though\nVerdict I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet\u0026hellip; but considering automatic resistance control (Peloton is not supporting), I was learning towards either NordicTrack Commercial S10i or Zwift setup (buy bike, trainer and monitor etc). But people love Peloton over NordiTrack because of (a) unlimited classes (b) magnetic resistance for easier adjustment.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-03-compare-indoor-cycling/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-goal\"\u003eThe Goal:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecide on most money worth indoor cycling bike and software options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotivation:\nI run almost everyday but some days, my knee hurts and some days it rain on me.\nFor those reasons, I have been thinking of other cardio option other than\nrunning and swimming.

Type the URL of the domain you\u0026rsquo;ve purchased.\nClick Save.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see an error with two CNAMEs. On \u0026ldquo;Name, Label or Host\u0026rdquo; column, 1st row it should show the subdomain you entered, like \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;www\u0026rdquo;. For the case of this example, it is \u0026ldquo;subdomain\u0026rdquo; For destination, it should show \u0026ldquo;ghs.googlehosted.com\u0026rdquo; and common to everyone.\nOn 2nd row destination, it is s different for each person and is specific to your blog and your Google Account.\nNow login to Cheapname and go to dashboard -\u0026gt; Domain List -\u0026gt; Advanced DNS Click \u0026ldquo;Add New Record\u0026rdquo; link at the bottom and select \u0026ldquo;CNAME Record\u0026rdquo; Enter value from \u0026ldquo;Name, Label or Host,\u0026rdquo; on Blogger as Host Enter value from \u0026ldquo;Destination, Target or Points to,\u0026rdquo; on Blogger which is \u0026ldquo;ghs.googlehosted.com\u0026rdquo; as value.

You can run curl localhost:9200 and all looks good but the access is denied from outside when curl \u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:9200.\nHow to solve it So first thing first. Elasticsearch do need to listen to ip you are accessing. To make it listen to all, you can simply change / add network.host: 0.0.0.0 to /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and restart elasticsearch server. Try curl \u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:9200 and works? That\u0026rsquo;s great. Your server is configured / ready for port 9200.\nIf your access is rejected then there are several things you can check:\nIs server running? Make sure to run systemctl status elasticsearch (assuming that you are managing the service via systemctl) If it says active then you are good.

This is where I stuck. So you see 9200 is LISTEN only on tcp6 and not for ipv4. I got stuck with this idea of ES is not bind to ipv4. Later I found this is good. See here for more details. but if you google \u0026ldquo;es not binding to ipv4\u0026rdquo; there are quite hit and I was trying to apply the suggestion (e.g. set environment variable to force using ipv4 etc export ES_JAVA_OPTS=\u0026quot;-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Addresses\u0026quot;) and had no luck of course because that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the problem as mentioned above.\nroot@bd-gpu01-s02:~# netstat -p tcp -na | grep 9200 tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43180 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43178 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43270 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp6 0 0 :::9200 :::* LISTEN 113888/java tcp6 0 0 10.102.111.221:9200 10.101.95.238:59009 ESTABLISHED 113888/java tcp6 0 0 10.102.111.221:9200 10.101.95.238:59002 ESTABLISHED 113888/java unix 3 [ ] STREAM CONNECTED 4089200 140511/python3.6 Is firewall allowing?

My newly added ufw-user-input (INPUT chain entered via ufw) was added at the very bottom. Below REJECT which rejects the packet.\nufw do have insert \u0026lt;position-number\u0026gt; but still puts below the INPUT REJECT on iptables. So what I end up doing is to insert at position 1 using iptables and finally worked\u0026hellip; phew.\n# insert a rule at line 1 iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 9200 -j ACCEPT ufw is nice syntax but I guess in order to be able to use it, you want to have clean iptables to starts with.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-08-22-es-access-from-outside/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou installed Elasticsearch on server.

You made changes and forgot to restart the program. Python will load files when program started, compile it to bytecode and keep it internally. But wait\u0026hellip; instead of setup.py, use pip It is highly recommended to use pip instead of setup.py. pip install . instead of setup.py install and pip install -e . instead of setup.py develop.\nBecause setup.py will do the wrong things for dependencies such as:\nSetuptools uses easy_install to fulfill these dependencies and it skip pip\u0026rsquo;s hash-checking easy_install does not exclude pre and post release versions as pip does. easy_install make the package hard to uninstall things or may not do clean job. Remember the spoiler alert? if you install with pip install -e . and run pip uninstall mypackage then find . -name 'myproject.*' won\u0026rsquo;t find anything.

I was breathing hard right away, trying to find rhythm while surrounded by so many strong runners. The biggest contingent came from Flagstaff, a town that clearly knows how to send mountain-ready athletes.\nThe route itself is deceptive. People say there’s “only one big hill.” But that hill stretches for 10 relentless miles, climbing 5,500 feet straight up to the summit at 13,000 feet.\nThe Cutoff: A Race Within the Race One of the toughest mental battles came at the 7.65-mile aid station, where there’s a hard cutoff at 2 hours 30 minutes. This year, 296 runners—about 24% of participants—didn’t make it. That knowledge was heavy as I approached the station, pushing through fatigue to make sure I’d be allowed to continue.\nIt reminded me so much of the Kendall Mountain Run and Crown King Scramble—steep climbs, thin air, and that gnawing question in the back of your mind: Can I really make it?\nThe Summit and the Storms At the top, the air felt razor-thin. Every step demanded focus. But the payoff—mountain views stretching forever—made every labored breath worthwhile.\nWe were incredibly lucky with the weather. Blue skies carried us over the pass, but by late afternoon, the mountains did what mountains do: a thunderstorm rolled in. Just like at Kendall, I was grateful to have finished before the skies opened.\nThe Finish: Walking Like a Baby Giraffe When it was all over, I was part of the 934 finishers out of 1,230 starters. My quads, however, might argue otherwise.

Aid stations were frequent and full of smiles, a lifeline when I needed it most.\nLooking Ahead Would I do Imogene again? Absolutely—but next time, I’d want to be more acclimated to the altitude.

Walking around the house for more than five minutes would give me some discomfort.\nDay 14 post-surgery: I was able to start biking and walking. I experienced lower back pain and discomfort resembling constipation or diarrhea, which I was told can be normal for some during the recovery process.\nWeek 4 post-surgery: I was able to run / walk (mostly walking). Slowly increased distance and pace.\nWeek 6 post-surgery: I was able to run at a recovery run pace though I experienced some discomfort and tightness in my abdomen.\nWeek 8 post-surgery: I felt more comfortable and was able to increase pace and distance.\nWeek 12 post-surgery, I was back to running 20-25 miles per week, just like before the surgery.\nDuring the recovery period, I embraced activities like biking and yoga, which helped me stay active and motivated. I am sure my fellow runners will also find new activities to embrace as they navigate their own recovery journey.\nHappy running and healing!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-04-01-hysterectomy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou might be reading this because you are told that Hysterectomy is the best option for removing uterine fibroids which has been bothering you a lot \u0026hellip; but your biggest concern is how soon you can get back to your beloved activity - running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a dilemma, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?

For those reasons, I have been thinking of other cardio option other than running and swimming. Biking seems so fun with right software and easy on your knee.\nSoftware Just like computer, without right software device (bike) won\u0026rsquo;t be much useful. You will be more motivated if software is good (addictive and stress free) and you will hopefully use your device to the full potential.\nSo I decided to look from angle of software perspective.\nThere are 3 notable software out there.\nzwfit is still in beta (as of 2018-10-03) but getting much attention from indoor cyclist. ifit Coach peloton Setup Options and other cost Zwift Your browser does not support the video element.\nThere are 3 level of setup. This video is very comprehensive.\nAssuming that you already have mountain bike. If not, add that to cost. $100 to $600+.\nBasic: * Bike home trainer * The cheapest one you can get starts from around $50. * Garmin speed sensor is less than $40 Flexible Setup * Bike home trainer * Power Meter. Power meter is is a device fitted to a bike that measures the power output of the rider. Most commonly, power meters use strain gauges that deflect slightly when a force is applied. By measuring this torque and combining it with angular velocity, power (measured in watts) can be calculated. It measure much more than speed and cost more than speed sensor. Premium Setup * Smart trainer which will give you automatic resistance. Smart trainer is available from around $230.\nAlso you want to have monitor. If you want dedicated monitor or tablet, include that in the cost as well.\nMonthly Membership Fee $14.99 (used to be $10)\nifit Coach iFit will give you access to:\nPersonal trainer Unlimited virtual travel Virtual gym membership Workout classes The official training bike is ProForm Tour De France which automatically simulates every hill and dip etc.\nThe software is also available on both Android and iOS and just like most software, review on Android is so low. Chances are depends on your device, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nMax Weight is 350lb.\nPer this review though\nThe automated incline/decline doesn’t always work iFit isn’t well-integrated with TDF bikes (Often crashes) So kind of \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;.\nOther compatible bike NordicTrack Commercial S10i Studio workout video automates your bike’s resistance and incline/decline to follow the coach’s plan. Comes with 10\u0026quot; Smart HD Touchscreen. $1500 includes first year membership cost. $500 more for 22 inch screen bike\niFit Coach membership with equipment:\nPay all at once and save 15% - $33 per month or opt to pay monthly for $39 per month\nPeloton Monthly subscription for the software is $39 if you own their bike. Standalone is $12.99 for a monthly membership but lacks various metrics as it is not linking to device. Currently Android OS user has no option. Peloton is only available on iOS and planning to release for Android on late 2018. So you could go with just buying good spin bike which ranges from\nBike comes with amazing 22 inch touchscreen. With its live-streaming and on-demand classes, costs roughly $3,000 for the first year (Bike $2000 + $250 for shipping and setup) and nearly $500 each year thereafter.\nWithout paying the $39 monthly subscription, you’re left with just three classes and a free-ride mode that displays only real-time data on the screen, with no leaderboard-inspired competition or any record of your efforts.\nNo automatic resistance control by the way.\nNice looking bike though\nVerdict I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet\u0026hellip; but considering automatic resistance control (Peloton is not supporting), I was learning towards either NordicTrack Commercial S10i or Zwift setup (buy bike, trainer and monitor etc). But people love Peloton over NordiTrack because of (a) unlimited classes (b) magnetic resistance for easier adjustment.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-03-compare-indoor-cycling/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-goal\"\u003eThe Goal:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecide on most money worth indoor cycling bike and software options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotivation:\nI run almost everyday but some days, my knee hurts and some days it rain on me.\nFor those reasons, I have been thinking of other cardio option other than\nrunning and swimming.

Type the URL of the domain you\u0026rsquo;ve purchased.\nClick Save.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see an error with two CNAMEs. On \u0026ldquo;Name, Label or Host\u0026rdquo; column, 1st row it should show the subdomain you entered, like \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;www\u0026rdquo;. For the case of this example, it is \u0026ldquo;subdomain\u0026rdquo; For destination, it should show \u0026ldquo;ghs.googlehosted.com\u0026rdquo; and common to everyone.\nOn 2nd row destination, it is s different for each person and is specific to your blog and your Google Account.\nNow login to Cheapname and go to dashboard -\u0026gt; Domain List -\u0026gt; Advanced DNS Click \u0026ldquo;Add New Record\u0026rdquo; link at the bottom and select \u0026ldquo;CNAME Record\u0026rdquo; Enter value from \u0026ldquo;Name, Label or Host,\u0026rdquo; on Blogger as Host Enter value from \u0026ldquo;Destination, Target or Points to,\u0026rdquo; on Blogger which is \u0026ldquo;ghs.googlehosted.com\u0026rdquo; as value.

You can run curl localhost:9200 and all looks good but the access is denied from outside when curl \u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:9200.\nHow to solve it So first thing first. Elasticsearch do need to listen to ip you are accessing. To make it listen to all, you can simply change / add network.host: 0.0.0.0 to /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and restart elasticsearch server. Try curl \u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:9200 and works? That\u0026rsquo;s great. Your server is configured / ready for port 9200.\nIf your access is rejected then there are several things you can check:\nIs server running? Make sure to run systemctl status elasticsearch (assuming that you are managing the service via systemctl) If it says active then you are good.

This is where I stuck. So you see 9200 is LISTEN only on tcp6 and not for ipv4. I got stuck with this idea of ES is not bind to ipv4. Later I found this is good. See here for more details. but if you google \u0026ldquo;es not binding to ipv4\u0026rdquo; there are quite hit and I was trying to apply the suggestion (e.g. set environment variable to force using ipv4 etc export ES_JAVA_OPTS=\u0026quot;-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Addresses\u0026quot;) and had no luck of course because that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the problem as mentioned above.\nroot@bd-gpu01-s02:~# netstat -p tcp -na | grep 9200 tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43180 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43178 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp 0 0 10.102.111.221:43270 192.168.202.121:9200 ESTABLISHED 31786/node tcp6 0 0 :::9200 :::* LISTEN 113888/java tcp6 0 0 10.102.111.221:9200 10.101.95.238:59009 ESTABLISHED 113888/java tcp6 0 0 10.102.111.221:9200 10.101.95.238:59002 ESTABLISHED 113888/java unix 3 [ ] STREAM CONNECTED 4089200 140511/python3.6 Is firewall allowing?

My newly added ufw-user-input (INPUT chain entered via ufw) was added at the very bottom. Below REJECT which rejects the packet.\nufw do have insert \u0026lt;position-number\u0026gt; but still puts below the INPUT REJECT on iptables. So what I end up doing is to insert at position 1 using iptables and finally worked\u0026hellip; phew.\n# insert a rule at line 1 iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 9200 -j ACCEPT ufw is nice syntax but I guess in order to be able to use it, you want to have clean iptables to starts with.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-08-22-es-access-from-outside/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe problem:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou installed Elasticsearch on server.

You made changes and forgot to restart the program. Python will load files when program started, compile it to bytecode and keep it internally. But wait\u0026hellip; instead of setup.py, use pip It is highly recommended to use pip instead of setup.py. pip install . instead of setup.py install and pip install -e . instead of setup.py develop.\nBecause setup.py will do the wrong things for dependencies such as:\nSetuptools uses easy_install to fulfill these dependencies and it skip pip\u0026rsquo;s hash-checking easy_install does not exclude pre and post release versions as pip does. easy_install make the package hard to uninstall things or may not do clean job. Remember the spoiler alert? if you install with pip install -e . and run pip uninstall mypackage then find . -name 'myproject.*' won\u0026rsquo;t find anything.
