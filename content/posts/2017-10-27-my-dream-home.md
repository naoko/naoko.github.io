### Milestone
- Aug 2000: We bought our first home. It was new build but had no money to do any upgrade.
    Selection of the house is also `cheap` was one of the most important criteria.
- Oct 2008: When housing tanked, we bought the foreclosed home built in 2001. It is the model that we wanted to buy
back in 2000 but could not afford. Walking distance to elementary school. It was perfect for us at the time.
- Sep 2017: We did not need or desperately wanted new house. We were living below our means and saved up 
good chunk of money. We were comfortable but we've decided to go outside of comfortable zone for various reasons and
decided to build this amazing house.
