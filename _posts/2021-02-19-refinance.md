Then there is this nerdwallet [refinance calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/refinance-calculator/calculate-refinance-savings) can give you precisely what might be your saving etc by entering your current mortgae and projected morgage rate.

from there you can click "Get Started" link at the bottom to see rates offered.

I locked rate at 1.75 with points (APR 2.0) last week. You should check it out and see how much you will be saving!
Make sure to consider:

1. How long you will be keeping your home etc rather than overall saving for life of the loan.
2. What is your primary goal (total saving, monthly saving or both)

Cheers!
